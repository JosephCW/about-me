            <h2>Current</h2>
            <p>
                I am a Senior CS major here at NWMSU who has one semester remaining.

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                I spent two years attending Metropolitan Community College before transferring up here. I've had 3
                internships
                prior to taking this class, but no experience developing full-stack applications. For about a year I worked
                at
                Wagner Logistics, a 3rd party shipping and logistics company in KC, MO developing Java based desktop
                applications along with working primarily with Oracle databases. The past two summers I have been working at
                American Century Investments doing data integration with DB2 and Oracle while building Java Spring
                Integration
                based tools and applications. In my free time I enjoy programming, playing video games and flying FPV
                drones.

            <h2>Future Plans</h2>
            <p>
                At the moment I'm not exactly sure what my plans are. I currently have a couple of different offers from
                companies that are interested in me since I graduate in January, but I have a couple of weeks to reach a
                decision. One would be doing ETL based data integration, one would be developing the backend for web/mobile
                applications using Java/Clojure while the third option is to do web development using Python.
