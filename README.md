## Recommended Resources
Here are some resources that I've found useful for development in the past. I don't have much experience with web technology but with the Javascript I've written the MDN web docs proved invaluable. Any type of development should be put under version control so a helpful git reference is also included. I recently found this web developers roadmap while looking for a form of guided study for backend web development. Seeing as it's also recommended by Dr. Case, I will personally be following this as well moving forward.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)
- [Atlassian's Learn Git Tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud)
- [Web Developer's Roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) (As suggested by Dr. Case)
