## About

This repo is being used to both share with the class information about myself and to share both tools and documentation that could be useful to someone learning web development.

## Required Tools

In order to publish web pages with Github Pages all you have to have is a web browser. Github Pages utilizes Markdown files (.md) so it would behoove you to also learn that. A link to learn Markdown is provided under the section titled 'Recommended Resources'. I would personally recommend one of the following:

- [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/)
- [Water Fox](https://www.waterfox.net/)
- [Iridium Browser](https://iridiumbrowser.de)

## Optional Tools / Route

Optionally if you prefer to do development locally on your machine and not in the browser, I would recommend the following tools as this is what I am using (On Windows).

- [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) (Along with preferred visual git client)
- [VS Code / Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - Install the following extensions
    - [markdownlint by David Anson](https://github.com/DavidAnson/vscode-markdownlint)
    - [Markdown Preview by Yiyi Wang](https://github.com/shd101wyy/vscode-markdown-preview-enhanced)

## Recommended Resources

Here are some resources that I've found useful for development in the past. I don't have much experience with web technology but with the Javascript I've written the MDN web docs proved invaluable. Any type of development should be put under version control so a helpful git reference is also included. I recently found this web developers roadmap while looking for a form of guided study for backend web development. Seeing as it's also recommended by Dr. Case, I will personally be following this as well moving forward. Beneath that is a resource that I find useful as a reference when writing Markdown.

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)
- [Atlassian's Learn Git Tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud)
- [Web Developer's Roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) (As suggested by Dr. Case)
- [DaringFireball's Markdown Documentation](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

## Contributors

My name is Joseph Watts and I'm currently a senior at Northwest Missouri State University majoring in Computer Science.
I can't have a contribution section without including an image of my lovely girlfriend, Danielle, along with myself at a dinner theatre event.
